**Using TestNG for Automation Testing!**
<br><br>
We will be using TestNG for executing test cases through Automation Testing. This repo will consist of basic Java files showcasing each functionality of TestNG,
along with Advance Java files showcasing end-to-end automation test suite.

Q. Why is TestNG Used?
<br>
A. TestNG (Test Next Generation) is a powerful testing framework for Java that is widely used in automation testing due to its flexibility, scalability, and enhanced test execution capabilities. 
<br><br>
Hereâ€™s why it is used:

1. Supports Annotations & Test Management
Provides powerful annotations (@Test, @BeforeSuite, @AfterTest, etc.) to define test methods and execution order.

2. Enables Parallel & Group Testing
Supports parallel test execution, reducing overall test execution time.

3. Generates Detailed Reports
Provides built-in HTML and XML reports with execution status, logs, and results.

4. Supports Data-Driven Testing
Works seamlessly with @DataProvider, enabling parameterization and testing multiple datasets.

5. Easy Integration with Selenium & CI/CD
Works efficiently with Selenium WebDriver for automation testing. Integrates with Maven, Jenkins, and TestNG Listeners for continuous integration.

6. Exception Handling & Dependency Management
Allows setting test dependencies (e.g., test execution order using dependsOnMethods).

7. Supports Soft & Hard Assertions
Uses TestNG assertions (Assert.assertEquals, SoftAssert) to validate expected vs. actual results.
